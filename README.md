# template-ssh-app

A garnix-compatible repo for deploying simple ssh apps (that is, apps that
you interact with via ssh).

To deploy your own:

1) Create a [garnix](https://garnix.io) account if you don't have one yet.
2) Fork this repo.
3) Make sure the garnix GitHub App is enabled on this repo.
4) Change the lines marked [TODO](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agarnix-io%2Ftemplate-ssh-app%20todo&type=code) to reflect your needs.
5) Push your changes! garnix will build and deploy the package.
6) (Optionally) set an A record pointing to the IP address you receive (you can
   find it in your [server](https://garnix.io/servers) tab).
